CS61A
=====

Coursework from UC Berkeley's <i>CS61A - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> (http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa14/). 

<b>Outlook:</b> I'm using this course primarily as an introduction to the fundamental concepts of computer science, and am not spending my time on every single project and homework assignment. My focus is on understanding the material to the point that I can apply it towards my own projects, and also having a solid foundation for future advanced courses.

<blockquote><b>Progress:</b> Material through midterm two complete (2/3 of course), as well as select topics after (exceptions, iterators and streams). Discussions 1-8 and exams 1-2 were completed by hand.</blockquote>
